/**
 * A custom Algolia InstantSearch RefinementList widget representing the Open
 * Now button.
 *
 * We implement this as a custom widget because we want to show users a
 * different representation of the search parameter than is actually stored
 * internally. Internally the open_times attribute is represented as an array of
 * times in 30-minute chunks, where the presence of a chunk indicates that the
 * organization or service is open during that chunk. Externally, we only want
 * to present a binary Open Now filter where activating the filter means
 * filtering for schedules where an open_times chunk exists for the user's
 * current local time.
 *
 * For example, if it is Sunday 10:00 AM locally, then enabling the Open Now
 * filter should filter for organizations or services which have 'Su-10:00' in
 * the open_times array.
